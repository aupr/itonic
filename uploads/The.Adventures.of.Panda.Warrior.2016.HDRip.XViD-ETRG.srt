    turned into a panda?

    Is it back there?

129
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,685
    Of course. Where else       
    did you think we were? Hmm? 

130
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,521
    Merryland really exists.    

131
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,989
Grandpa told me the truth.      

132
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,025
All right, it's true! Ha ha!    

133
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,227
        [groaning]              

134
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,529
Hey, is something               
wrong with your butt?           

135
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,064
You gonna be all right?         

136
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,100
                    Yeah, sure. 
                    Uh-huh.     

137
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,903
        Thanks. I guess I should
        introduce myself.       

138
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,672
        I'm Patrick.            
        Who are you?            

139
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,141
    - Peggy Skyflyer.           
    - Peggy Skyflyer?           

140
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,077
    - Yep.                      
    - So you can really fly?    

141
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,645
Why is that so surprising?      

142
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,948
            Hmm. Yeah, right.   

143
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,951
    I guess nothing should be   
    surprising at this point.   

144
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,887
    Exactly. You're a           
    talking panda after all.    

145
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,857
[scoffs]                        
But I wasn't a panda before.    

146
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,992
    I have no idea why I        
    turned into a panda         

147
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,527
    all of the sudden.          

148
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,829
    Oh, I see. So maybe         
    you're not a real panda.    

149
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,898
        Huh? Looks real to me.  

150
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,133
    What else do you call       
    a black-and-white bear?     

151
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,103
But are you the                 
legendary Panda Warrior?        

152
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,773
    Huh? Panda Warrior?         

153
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,842
    Hmm. Well, it's pretty      
    hard to imagine you         

154
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,277
    as much of a warrior.       

155
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,246
    Yeah, yeah. Not so much.    

156
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,682
    Ha ha. You got yourself     
    the wrong panda.            

157
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,552
        Now! Whaaa!             

158
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,120
        Oooh, whaaa!            

159
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,255
        [vibrating lips]        

160
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,091
        And, launch!            
        [farting]               

161
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,927
Gross! That is so stinky!       

162
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,665
        Ah! Whoo!               

163
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,735
Well, would you look at that?   
Who knew?                       

164
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,670
    Pigs really can fly!        

165
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,804
        Well, of course.        

166
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,607
    See ya, panda!              
    I'm on a mission.           

167
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,943
        Got a lot to do.        
        [chuckling]             

168
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,948
    Wowee!                      
    It's beautiful here.        

169
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,184
    Merryland is such           
    a wonderful place.          

170
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,819
        [laughing]              

171
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,588
        Hey, there.             

172
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,124
            Huh?                

173
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,764
        Oh, well, hi.           

174
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,232
[heavy footsteps approaching]   

175
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,834
                    What's that?
                    Oh, hey.    

176
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,307
    How's it goin', guys?       
    Hey, ah...                  

177
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,810
    - [swords swinging]         
    - [Patrick groaning]        

178
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,321
    [bouncing sounds mixed      
    with sword sounds]          

179
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,293
        - [cats] Hee-ya!        
        - Not again!            

180
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,662
            Help!               

181
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:01,199
            Hiyah!              

182
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,301
    [Patrick] Wow.              
    That was amazing,           

183
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,337
but why were they attacking me? 

184
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,640
        The Phantom Army Cats   
        are all mind-controlled.

185
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,842
        - Phantom Army?         
        - Mmm-hmm.              

186
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,978
            By the Evil Master. 

187
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,646
        What? But wait.         

188
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,615
    I thought Merryland was     
    supposed to be a place      

189
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,116
    of peace and harmony.       

190
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,352
        It was many years ago.  

191
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,354
Why isn't it anymore?           

192
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,255
            Unfortunately,      
            most of Merryland   

193
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,224
            is under the control
            of the Evil Master. 

194
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,361
        It's no longer the      
        paradise it once was.   

195
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,063
Isn't there anyone who          
can defeat the Evil Master?     

196
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,965
    No. No one has been able to.

197
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,101
            The only one who    
            can is a true hero. 

198
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,702
        And who's that?         

199
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,372
    The legendary Panda Warrior.

200
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,307
            Oh. Hmm.            

201
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,844
You may be a panda,             
but you're certainly no warrior.

202
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,178
            Hmm.                

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,681
    That's what I've            
    been tryin' to tell ya.     

204
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,250
Hey! Not so fast!               

205
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,687
    Hey, where you goin'?       

206
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,056
        Ah, oh, oh!             

207
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,259
    [sighing] All right.        
    Why are you following me?   

208
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,294
        Uh, well.               

209
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,296
I'm afraid the Phantom          
Army will come back             

210
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,867
and you don't want me           
joining up with them, do ya?    

211
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,035
        [Peggy snorting]        

212
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,103
    [Patrick chortling]         

213
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,905
I can tell you're a             
really nice person.             

214
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,407
Otherwise, you wouldn't         
have saved me, would ya?        

215
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,941
    Huh? What else could I do?  

216
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,143
And I'm truly grateful for it.  

217
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,411
I mean, I don't know            
what I would have done          

218
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,812
if you hadn't come along.       

219
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,881
Hey, knock it off, all right?   

220
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:23,982
            And don't follow me.

221
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,350
            But...              

222
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,722
That's the Evil                 
Master's dark forest.           

223
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,023
Set one foot inside and his     
army could easily find you.     

224
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,293
        [shuddering]            

225
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,031
        Hey, so we're not       
        goin' in there, right?  

226
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,233
When night falls, there'll      
be many army patrols.           

227
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,036
It's a dangerous place,         
especially for you.             

228
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,205
Just stay out here if           
you want to be caught.          

229
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,940
            Heeeyah!            

230
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,776
[Patrick] Hey, wait for me!     

231
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,251
    [Patrick panting]           

232
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,294
- Hey, calm down, will ya?      
- Who can be calm?              

233
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,996
Shhh! You have to be quiet.     

234
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,932
If you aren't careful,          
the big monster,                

235
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:17,102
who lives here,                 
will find us, all right?        

236
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,470
    There's a monster in here?  

237
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,205
        [Peggy snorting]        

238
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:24,809
A big one, but you see,         
no one who's ever seen it       

239
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,511
has ever returned alive.        

240
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,748
No survivors have ever returned 
from the monster's clutches.    

241
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,116
    Now I'm really scared!      

242
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,250
        [Peggy laughing]        

243
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,185
        - Hey!                  
        - Just kidding.         

244
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,520
You're pretty                   
gullible, aren't you?           

245
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,289
        [Peggy laughing]        

246
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,427
        Whoaaah!                
        Oh, no! Help!           

247
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,195
    [spider growling]           

248
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,498
What is that scary thing?       
That's a lot of teeth!          

249
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,135
    You think he's mad at       
    us for some reason?         

250
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,540
    [spider growling]           

251
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,375
        Oh, yeah? Ha!           

252
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,810
            Yah!                

253
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,245
        Hey, hey.               

254
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,514
    Help! What's going on?      

255
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,087
    Watch out,                  
    spider, here I come!        

256
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,923
        Yah! Yah!               

257
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,360
        Take that!              

258
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,797
        Hey, wait.              

259
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,970
        - Oh, no.               
        - Help!                 

260
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,105
    What're we going to do?     

261
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,540
    I thought you had           
    this figured out.           

262
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,076
Be quiet! Unless you want       
to be spider bait.              

263
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,545
We gotta get out of here.       

264
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,246
    [Patrick] This is it!       

265
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,482
        [Peggy farting]         

266
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,352
            Huh?                

267
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,127
[Peggy making karate sounds]    

268
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,864
    [wood clattering]           

269
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,568
    Wow. That was amazing!      

270
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,136
        You're awesome!         

271
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,004
Oh, hey, wait. Let me           
help you with that.             

272
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,439
Starting a fire is              
harder than it looks.           

273
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,373
            Fine.               

274
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,275
    [Patrick humming]           

275
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,245
    - Need some help?           
    - I got this.               

276
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,913
        [Peggy sighing]         

277
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,349
    - Here.                     
    - I'm almost done.          

278
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,385
    I think I got it.           
    I almost saw an ember.      

279
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,358
        [Peggy laughing]        

280
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,026
[click, then flames whooshing]  

281
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,628
            Hey!                

282
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,029
Wait, how'd you do that?        

283
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,197
        [Peggy laughing]        

284
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,900
            It's an invention   
            called a lighter.   

285
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,603
Amazing! You can make a fire    
without hurting your paws.      

286
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:32,904
            Mmm-hmm.            

287
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,472
Hey, let me take                
a closer look at it.            

288
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:38,276
        - Mmm-hmm.              
        - Cool, thanks.         

289
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,613
                    Whatever.   

290
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,915
    Uh, how exactly             
    does this thing work?       

291
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,017
    Here. Let me show you.      

292
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,152
[lighter sparking and exploding]

293
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,487
        I can't breathe.        

294
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,656
    - [Patrick yelling]         
    - [Peggy coughing]          

295
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,559
[Patrick] It's dangerous to     
play with fire. You OK?         

296
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,128
            Yeah.               

297
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,232
It's pretty obvious you         
need to take me with you        
on your journey.                

298
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,600
I'll fight the Evil Master, too.

299
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,635
                            No! 

300
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,371
But you need some               
help, don't you?                

301
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,673
        - No way!               
        - Why not?              

302
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,108
I'll do whatever you want me to.

303
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,342
            Really?             

304
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,410
        Sure, just ask.         

305
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,012
I'll do whatever you say.       

306
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,247
                Hmm. All right. 
                Fine, then.     

307
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,383
        In that case, go join   
        the Evil Master's side. 

308
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:21,019
- That'll help us out a lot.    
- OK, got it.                   

309
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,456
Uh... am I that useless?        

310
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,557
                            Yes!

311
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,960
    [Patrick sighing]           

312
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,375
        Hey.                    
        Why do you wanna help?  

313
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,578
I wanna help because the        
world's in chaos right now.     

314
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,982
And I don't want                
Merryland to be that way.       

315
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,385
    The Merryland that I've     
    heard of is supposed        
    to be a peaceful place.     

316
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,689
A place where everyone can      
live in peace and harmony,      

317
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,159
and I wanna protect that peace. 

318
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,461
    I'm on a mission.           
    I have to go.               

319
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,129
    To spy on the Phantom Army. 

320
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,398
    But I've no time to         
    take care of you.           

321
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,034
I can take care of myself.      
Don't you worry.                

322
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,704
    I hope so. I can't be       
    responsible for your safety.

323
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,506
Are you kidding? I'm a real     
expert at being careful.        

324
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,408
I can take care of you, too.    

325
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,478
I'm good on my own. Taking care 
of yourself is enough.          

326
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,747
Really?                         
Then you'll let me come along?  

327
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,582
        Mmm. It's not up to me. 

328
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,584
            King Leo will make  
            the final decision. 

329
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,720
Oh, I love it.                  
I give you my word.             

330
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,021
    I won't let you down.       

331
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,489
    I won't ever let you...     

332
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,125
            Whoa!               

333
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,461
[Peggy and Patrick groaning]    

334
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:42,333
    - Sorry.                    
    - Oh, man, I totally        
    regret it already.          

335
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,470
Uh, you can't go                
through life with regrets,      

336
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,172
    but no more green gas!      

337
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,443
    Hey, it's not fair.         

338
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,644
Pigs can eat whatever they want.

339
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,313
I can only eat bamboo shoots.   

340
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,383
        - Whatever.             
        - Boring, right?        

341
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,084
I'll tell you, Skyflyer...      

342
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,352
    It's not safe here.         

343
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,287
    - Run while you can.        
    - What's that?              

344
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,655
Are you talking in your sleep?  

345
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,358
Bet you're dreaming about       
that spider fight, huh?         

346
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,494
        [whispering]            
        Run! Now!               

347
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,229
    Once again,                 
    you totally saved us.       

348
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,497
        [whispering]            
        Quiet down.             

349
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,465
    Well, I can't blame         
    you for resting.            

350
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,601
    I'd take a break,           
    too, if I were you.         

351
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,302
        [whispering]            
        I said, "Run."          

352
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,805
    "Run?" What was that?       
    What d'you say? Hmm?        

353
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,374
    I said, "Run,"              
    before it's too late.       

354
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,145
    - [loud crashing noise]     
    - [yelling]                 

355
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,716
    Ah? The Dragon Necklace.    

356
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,119
Where did you get that necklace?

357
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,088
        - Huh?                  
        - You heard me.         

358
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,524
- Start talking.                
- It was my grandfather's.      

359
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,392
    - A family heirloom.        
    - Stop talking!             

360
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,561
    That is Princess            
    Angelica's necklace,        

361
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,129
your grandfather stole it.      

362
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,131
No, he didn't.                  
My grandpa's not a thief.       

363
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,834
    He was. A thief never       
    admits his true nature.     

364
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,637
    Your grandfather was a      
    slimy, stinking crook!      

365
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,273
How dare you                    
insult my grandpa!              

366
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,541
            [grunts]            

367
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,477
Now you will pay for            
your grandfather's crime!       

368
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,648
[pincers singing like swords]   

369
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,385
No one insults my grandpa!      

370
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,719
            Grrrr!              

371
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:12,490
        [fighting]              

372
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,708
    Take it back, right now.    

373
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,479
No. I refuse to take            
back a single word, panda.      

374
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,814
        - Yah!                  
        - Too slow!             

375
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,685
    [fighting and yelling]

right now and take him down.

    If you could beat him,      

506

Enough. No insect bosses me.    

508
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,085

00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,624
Could you free the              
entire Phantom Army, too?       

511
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,027
    I always need time          
    to rest after I perform

    I can't free them all.      

515

    Well, that's weird,         
    but I understand.

    out a lot already.          

517

    The Phantom Army will       
    eventually return here.     

518
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:19,743
    You should go now.          
    Farewell, panda.

    it quite clear that         

632
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,693
    - he's a river horse.

        you're a hippo horse.

    Hello, Patrick, how are you?

Nice to meet you, GoGo Goat.

He's a brainiac from Merryland.

He invented every one           
of the weapons I use.

    isn't strong enough.

    I'll have to go back to

Hello, everyone. We're back.    

675
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,374
    I brought my friends,       
    and Patrick the Panda.      

676
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,144
[overlapping voices saying "Hi"]

677
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,246
    We can find out if he's     
    the Panda Warrior or not    

678
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:12,115
    when we bring him           
    to meet King Leo.           

679
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,785
    He'll know for sure         
    if he's the one.            

680
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,554
So, I take it you               
have roots here?                

681
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,688
            Mmm-hmm.            

682
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,123
Where are your defense forces?  

683
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,258
    They're all here.           

684
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,126
    - Just the seven of you?    
    - Mmm-hmm.                  

685
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,128
            Well, that's more   
            than sufficient.    

686
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,131
We are the best seven wonders.  
Never mind the others.          

687
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,567
No matter who the enemy is,     
whether they're the Phantom Army

688
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,336
or their Evil Master,           
I can K.O. them in round one    

689
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,672
with one talon tied             
behind my tail.                 

690
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,207
        - Mm.                   
        - Mm-hmm.

692
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,679
    He is big and round         
    and black and white.        

693
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,449
    You're the Panda            
    Warrior, aren't you?        

694
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,784
Oh, no. That's not me.          

695
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,086
I'm very flattered, though.     

696
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,520
        It's just like          
        the legend said.        

697
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,156
He's big, fat, black and white. 

698
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:57,260
[bleating] It's real nice       
to meet you, Panda Warrior.     

699
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,628
    But you see, I'm not.       

700
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,831
        Got to hurry.           

701
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:05,402
        I need to report        
        to King Leo.            

702
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,271
    [all] Your majesty.         

703
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,174
        Greetings.              

704
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:16,346
King Leo, we're back,           
and these are my brave friends  
who have come here with me      

705
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,881
because they want               
to join our team,               

706
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,317
and this is Patrick Panda.      

707
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,752
He's wearing the                
ancient Dragon Necklace.        

708
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,455
Maybe he is the                 
legendary Panda Warrior,        

709
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,491
but that remains to be seen.    

710

    [Shadowfeet] Look, the      
    necklace is glowing!

    [Necklace shimmering        
    and ringing]                

713
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,737
    This is indeed              
    the Dragon Necklace.        

714
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,240
    [voices overlapping         
    with "Hooray"]              

715
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:47,511
        Like I told you,        
        he is the Panda Warrior.

716
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:51,248
    [sighs] He is not the       
    legendary Panda Warrior.

    - [everyone sighing]        
    - Oh, dear.                 

718
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,684
    That's what I said.         

719
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,354
    How could a coward          
    be the Panda Warrior?       

720
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,389
    The Panda Warrior should    
    be strong and brave,        

721
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,690
        just like me.           

722
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,325
        Here, fetch!            

723
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,393
    Go, go, go, go, go!

after your long journey.

to that rule, Patrick.

    befell Merryland.

    I had never seen before

756

    <i> a despicable rat</i>           
    <i> with a despicable plan</i>     

758
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,256
    <i> snuck into Merryland</i>       

759
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,424
    <i> from an evil parallel</i>      
    <i> dimension.</i>                 

760

763
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:51,868
<i>transforming himself into a</i>     
<i>terrifying nine-headed snake.</i>   

764
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,038
    <i> He was too powerful</i>        
    <i> for anyone to resist.</i>      

765
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,007
    <i> He destroyed everyone</i>      
    <i> who disobeyed him</i>          

766
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,510

767
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,846

    <i> and forced to form</i>         
    <i> his Phantom Army.</i>          

769
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,053
So, you can see how             
desperate everyone of us are,   

770
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:12,689
        for the Panda Warrior   
        to come back            

771
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,725
and rescue us, as he did before.

772
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:20,030
I'm sorry. I wish I was the     
Panda Warrior, but I'm not.     

773
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:23,800
        Patrick, Panda Warrior  
        is nothing more         
        than a mythical name.   

774
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,036
Whoever has faith and courage   

775
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,705
        is the true             
        Panda Warrior of legend.

776
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:33,643
But sir, I'm nothing            
more than a useless coward.     

777
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,478
        Don't you know there's  
        no one in the world     

778
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,515
        who could look down     
        upon you than yourself. 

779
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,651
    Our only hope lies in the   
    return of the long-awaited  

780
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,853
        Panda Warrior, Jin Long.

781
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,088
            Grandpa?            

782
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,589
    [King Leo laughing]         

783
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,924
        You are his descendant? 

784
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,628
    - I see.                    
    - Huh? Wait a minute.       

785
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,630
    The Panda Warrior           
    came and rescued you        

786
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,398
    five years ago, right?      

787
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,802
    But by then, my grandpa     
    had already passed away.    

788
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,837
He can't be your Panda Warrior. 

789
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,539
I heard from Princess Angelica  

790
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,674
    the time in Merryland       
    moves differently           

791
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,809
    than the outside world,     

792
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,944
    so the timing makes         
    perfect sense.              

793
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:11,047
    It appears to me that       
    your Dragon Necklace        

794
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,417
    is the strongest            
    evidence of that.           

795
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:17,587
    Your grandfather            
    giving you the necklace     

796
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,724
    and your arrival            
    here at this time           

797
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,526
is more than a coincidence.     

798
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,899
    That is something to        
    consider, Patrick.          

799
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:42,579
Well, I'm convinced             
my grandfather was              
the Panda Warrior               

800
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,481
And I must keep his reputation, 

801
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,116
and so I will help              
you save Merryland              

802
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,650
from the Evil Master.           

803
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,686
    Huh? What do you mean,      
    you'll help?                

804
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,154
Is this some kind of a joke?    

805
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,123
    And how is it               
    that you suddenly           

806
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,592
            believe that you    
            can save Merryland? 

807
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,528
    I found my                  
    courage and passion.        

808
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,599
                All right, then,
                prove it to me.

813
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,018
            OK.                 

814
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,788
    So, that is your            
    courage and passion?        

815
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,158

        Ah. Give up now.        

821
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,747
I'll never, ever give up.       

822

        Then catch me.

824
00:40:55,187 --> 00:41:00,623
If you can't even beat me,      
how is it that you expect       
to beat the Evil Master?        

825
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,993
    I understand, so please,    
    King Leo, train me          
    to defeat him.              

826
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,662
    You think you have          
    the courage it takes        

827
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,930
    to become a warrior?        

828

        - I do.                 
        - Very well.            

829
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:13,236
    In that case,               
    I will train you, Patrick.  

830
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,972
    - Yes!                      
    - You all train             
    yourselves, understood?     

831
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,541
        [all] Yes, sir.

Wow, what a wonderful place.    

835
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:40,096
    Doubt you'll be             
    saying that later.

    [King Leo laughing]

Oh. I should have figured.      

838
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,169
Your first training task        
is to use these lilies          

839
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,871
to jump across the river.       

840
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,572
    Sounds simple enough.       

841

    - You really think so?      
    - Haha. Yeah, sure.

    are tougher than this!

These flowers have teeth!       

848

    Oh, didn't I warn you?      
    Sorry. My bad.              

849
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,803
    They're piranha flowers     
    and they're hungry,         

850
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,305
    so be careful to not        
    become their lunch.

    training is this?

    manage on your own,         

854
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,979
    or it wouldn't be           
    training, now would it?     

855
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,281
    And one more thing.         

856
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,316
    These lilies have           
    a surprise inside.          

857

860
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,193
    Don't look, GoGo.           

861

        Ah, my tail!            

862
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:51,034
    Let go of my tail!

    Huh?                        
    The lake is so shallow.     

865
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,011
    I don't need to             
    jump to get across.         

866
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,279
        I can just walk.        

867
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,181
    Yeah, well,                 
    if I were you, I'd run!     

868
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,050
    Give me one good reason.    

869
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,786
    Uh, this lake is            
    full of piranha fish.       

870
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,120
        That's one.             

871
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:14,057
    [Peggy] I said,             
    "Run." Go Panda, go!        

872
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,358
    I finished. I passed.       

873
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,293
Sorry, you failed the test,     

874
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,596

    without getting wet.

00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,273
    [waterfall sounds]          

881
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,946
So, your majesty,               
what exactly do you have        
in store for me next?           

882
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,148
    - [King Leo] Look there.    
    - Yah!                      

883
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,284
    What, more water?           

884
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,653
    A piranha lake and          
    now a piranha river?        

885
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:48,391
        Don't worry,            
        there are no fish to be 
        afraid of in this river.

886
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:50,627
This time it's extremely simple.

887
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,163
All you need to do is fill      
the two buckets with water.     

888
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,865
And that's all there is to it?  

889
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,201
    Well, not exactly.          

890
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,969
    [Patrick groaning]          

891
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,905
    I knew it couldn't          
    be that easy.               

892
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:11,914
    [Patrick groaning]          

893
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,960
        I got this one.         

894
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,063
        [splashing]             

895
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,998
        No! Not again!          

896
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
    This one is a               
    bit more dangerous.         

897
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,669
    - Peggy Skyflyer?           
    - Huh?                      

898
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,070
[King Leo] Please demonstrate.  

899
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:37,140
        Uh, yes, sire.          

900
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,411
    [bamboo whizzing by]        

901
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:46,282
        [Peggy grunting]        

902
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,084
            Whaaaa!             

903
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,021
            Huh?                

904
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,256
        [Peggy farting]         

905
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:58,094
        [Peggy yelling]         

906
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:00,930
        [all cheering]          

907
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,067
    Now, it's your turn.        

908
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,835
            OK.                 

909
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:11,107
    [chomping loudly]           

910
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:17,814
[King Leo] The world            
certainly is full of surprises. 

911
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:21,718
    Patrick, you truly          
    are the chosen one.         

912
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:28,991
    [groaning and hissing]      

913
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:34,363
You can keep me here,           
but the citizens of Merryland   

914
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,065
    must not be hurt.           

915
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,202
    You are a creature          
    born of the Dragon Ball     

916
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,803
    and when you are gone,      

917
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:43,072
the Dragon Ball will disappear. 

918
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,975
I will not be tricked by you.   

919
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,411
    What do you want?           

920
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,179
        You shall see.          

921
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:54,917
    The poison water will       
    drain away the goodness     
    in your heart.              

922
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,420
    When the Dragon Ball is     
    drained of its goodness     

923
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,858
and finally turns dark and evil,
I will absorb its energy        

924
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,361
    and become more powerful    
    than you can imagine.       

925
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:09,098
When that day arrives,          
nothing will be able to stop me.

926
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,770
I'll conquer Merryland first    
and move on to the              
rest of your world.             

927
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,139
    The Panda Warrior's         
    coming back for you.        

928
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,876
    I think not,                
    Princess Angelica.          

929
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,378
Even your previous              
Panda Warrior would find it     

930
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,848
    next to impossible          
    to defeat me now.           

931
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,185
    I still have faith          
    that the panda will come    
    and save us all.            

932
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:30,953
        That's because          
        you have no idea        

933
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,789
of the ways of the world.       

934
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:36,325
Your fate lies here, Princess.  

935
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:45,468
[King Leo]                      
<i>Patrick, now you understand</i>     
<i>the challenges of the world.</i>    

936
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,504
    Always treasure             
    your Dragon Necklace.       

937
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,006
        Hold on to it.          

938
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:53,075
In your most desperate moment,  
call upon its power,            

939
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,011
and use it to save yourself.    

940
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,046
    You have earned             
    your magical sword.         

941
00:46:57,048 --> 00:47:01,818
I sincerely hope you can help us
defeat the Evil Master          
and save Merryland.             

942
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,519
    I will do my best.          

943
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,924
    Wait just a minute.         

944
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:11,093
We can't let him be the leader  
just because of his grandpa.    

945
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:13,095
        I object!               
        [grunts]                

946
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,897
    What do you                 
    suggest we do then?         

947
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,934
    I challenge him             
    to be the leader.           

948
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,570
    Patrick, do you             
    accept the challenge?       

949
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:22,939
    We should unite to          
    fight the Evil Master,      

950
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,173
    not fight each other.       

951
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,875
    What if I lose or get       
    hurt or something?          

952
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,477
Hah. That's because             
you know I'll defeat you.       

953
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,314
Maybe so, but if you really     
want a challenge,               

954
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,850
    let's see who can defeat    
    the Evil Master first?      

955
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,084
    Right. You're on!           

956
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,320
    But you're gonna lose.      

957
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,494
        [all cheering]          

958
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:52,068
    The Evil Master lives       
    in a floating castle.       

959
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,570
    Unfortunately, it has       
    no fixed location,          

960
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:56,339
    so it's impossible          
    to know where it is         

961
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,074
    at any given time.          

962
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,475
    Oh, dear.                   
    I don't want to spend       

963
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:02,645
the rest of my life searching   
for some floating castle.       

964
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,214
What should we do, Patrick?     

965
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,117
    My master, the Fox          
    Elder, is a magician.       

966
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,319
    She might be able           
    to help us out.             

967
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,154
    Then we should go and       
    find her right away.        

968
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,256
    - [Peggy] Right. Huh?       
    - No!                       

969
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,657
She doesn't trust anyone.       

970
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:18,427
    Except for maybe            
    the Panda Warrior.          

971
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,564
            Huh?                

972
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,636
    Listen carefully.           

973
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:29,505
This is a piece of the floating 
castle's foundation stone.      

974
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:33,209
It's very rare and contains     
mysterious magical powers.      

975
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:36,545
Take it with you                
and it will lead you            
to the castle's location.       

976
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:40,316
Yeah! This is going to be       
lights-out for the Evil Master. 

977
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,151
            [grunts]            

978
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,985
    And take this. It has       
    a special note inside.      

979
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,155
Open it if you should           
ever find yourself              

980
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,157
    in terrible danger.         

981
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,192
        Understand?             

982
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,131
        Yes, Fox Elder.         

983
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,999
    [Patrick] Thank you         
    for your guidance, ma'am.   

984
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,367
[Fox Elder] You're welcome.     

985
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:01,237
Where are the Seven Wonders?    
They should be here.            

986
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,405
            [groans]            

987
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:03,673
            Huh?                

988
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,942
I sure hope they're             
not in danger.                  

989
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,443
    [GoGo Goat] Help me.        

990
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,612
    Hi, GoGo Goat.              
    No, I wasn't scared.        

991
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,280
    Are you all right?          
    Everything OK?              

992
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,581
    [Bernie swatting reeds]     

993
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,418
        I'm fine, but...        
        [crying]                

994
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,553
GoGo, what                      
happened to everyone?           

995
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:22,024
It was awful.                   
The Phantom Army attacked us.   

996
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,060
    Where's everyone else?      

997
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,494
        I don't know.           

998
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:28,064
    Bruce Barkley dug a         
    hole and hid me in it,      

999
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:31,000
but I'm afraid everyone         
else may have been captured.    

1000
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,234
            Oh, no.             

1001
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:35,037
    Forget about finding        
    the Evil Master.            

1002
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,374
    The others may be part      
    of the Phantom Army now.    

1003
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,309
GoGo, please don't give up.     

1004
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,078
Who else can save them, but us? 

1005
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,512
    We have to do it.           

1006
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,982
    But first, we need to       
    find out where they are.    

1007
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,718
    - I can't right now.        
    - But why?                  

1008
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,053
    Because I need              
    to take a shower.           

1009
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,621
I'm all dirty from hiding.      

1010
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,992
    I need to freshen up        
    before I can help out.      

1011
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,660
            Uhh.                

1012
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:07,503
                This way, guys. 

1013
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,653
            Why don't you just  
            let me take them?   

1014
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,389
        You can't.              

1015
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,191
Look over there.                

1016
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,293
        [Bernie] Whoa!

1018
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:37,366
    All right, finally.         

1019
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,176
    So how do we get all        
    the way up there?           

1020
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:50,713
        If Peggy Skyflyer       
        was here, she'd know.   

1021
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,681
        I have a plan.          

1022
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:57,820
            Huh?                

1023
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,789
Your horn is nothing but a fake.

1024
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,457
Fake is such a strong word.     

1025
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,326
    Can't a girl have a         
    few beauty secrets?         

1026
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,195
Hah!

        There she is!           

1030
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,319
    Peggy Skyflyer, it's us!    

1031
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:34,156
Looks like she's been turned    
into a Phantom Army soldier.    

1032
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:37,159
You dare to enter the           
castle without permission?      

1033
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,295
    You are all doomed!

00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:56,612
Nice try, but your              
little darts won't hurt me.     

1037
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,581
Huh. We'll see about that.      

1038
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,649
    I'll inform the Phantom     
    General you're here         

1039
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,852
and we'll destroy you all!

    Even when she's             
    under mind control,         

1042
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,125
she has no sense of direction.  

1043
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,292
    Don't let her go.           

1044
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,427
    We gotta capture her.       

1045
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,662
    You got it.                 
    How you want her cooked?    

1046
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,663
[Patrick] Don't hurt her.       

1047
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,332
    Ah, you're no fun.

1050

00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,382
    I bet Manny Mantis          
    and the others              

1054
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:36,152
are bewitched and part of       
the Phantom Army now, too.      

1055
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:38,754
Oh, no. I really don't          
want to have to fight them.     

1056
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:42,591
The only way to save them       
is to take down that            
nine-headed snake.              

1057
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,293

        Let's go.               

1059
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,706
    This castle is like a maze. 
    Which way should we go?     

1060
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:01,243
Just be sure to keep an eye out 
for the nine-headed snake.

Follow me, guys. Though I have  
not been here long,             

1062
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,381
    I do know every             
    corner of the castle.

1065

[all] Stay where you are.

        That's right.

like it when things get dirty.

    we should do next?

Well, first, we should ask them 
where the Evil Master is.

No. I think we should

00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:26,715
    in an awful place           
    and needs to be rescued now.

1131
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,684
            Yeah.               

1132
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,652
Can you take us right           
to her, Crusher the Ox?         

1133
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:33,689
        Yes, of course, I can.  
        It would be an honor.   

1134
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,427
    Uh. General, sir.           

1135
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,662
    Step aside. Move it!        

1136
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:43,065
Yes, sir. Sorry, General.       

1137
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:48,871
    - How much further?         
    - Not too far.              

1138
00:56:56,147 --> 00:57:00,549
[groans] This place smells worse
than Peggy's gas bombs.         

1139
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,119
It's enough to make me          
wanna cock-a-doodle croak.      

1140
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,587
    I can't take any more.      

1141
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,824
Hey, we're all in the           
same stinky boat for now.       

1142
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:16,532
Princess Angelica,              
we're here to rescue you.       

1143
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:20,169
    I have been waiting for     
    all of you to come here.    

1144
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,739
        [evil laughter]         

1145
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,508
[all gasping in surprise]       

1146
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,110
    We've been tricked.         

1147
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,779
    Crusher the Ox,             
    why'd you sell us out?      

1148
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,915
        I wouldn't trick        
        my own rescuers.        

1149
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:35,017
    Ah-hah! I'm the one         
    who fooled you, suckers!    

1150
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:37,486
    - Why you--                 
    - Hey. I want to            
    know what you've done       

1151
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:38,954
    with Princess Angelica.     

1152
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,656
        I bet you do.           

1153
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:45,694
You will find her locked        
away in the cave behind me.     

1154
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:50,499
    However, I will never       
    allow you to pass.          

1155
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,769
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just have 
to see about that, won't we?    

1156
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,804
All right. Let's charge him.    

1157
00:57:55,806 --> 00:58:00,108
        [all yelling]           

1158
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,693
    [Bernie] Snake eyes!        

1159
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,695
    - [GoGo] He got him!        
    - All right.                

1160
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:21,930
        Good job, Bunny.        

1161
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,867
    Old nine heads isn't        
    so powerful after all!      

1162
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,102
        We got this.            

1163
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,972
            [growls]            

1164
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,574
        [all whimpering]        

1165
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,212
        [laughing]              
        You lose.               

1166
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:40,249
    The Rebellion of the        
    Seven Wonders ends here.    

1167
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:41,984
    [Peggy] Bring it, ugly.     

1168
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,920
        [Peggy shouting]        

1169
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,835
        [shrieks]               

1170
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:03,572
Huh? You regenerated?           
But that's against the rules!   

1171
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,840
        [screams]               

1172
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,675
    Everyone, together.         

1173
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,310
    Unless we attack all        
    nine heads at once,         

1174
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,012
we won't be able to stop it.    

1175
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:15,217
There's nothing I despise       
more than filthy traitors.      

1176
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:23,959
        [whooping]              

1177
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:26,962
Hah. Hiyah!                     

1178
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:31,633
        [GoGo moaning]          

1179
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,102
        My hair.                
        How dare you!           

1180
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:36,238
        [groaning]              

1181
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,942
    [crowing painfully]         

1182
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:49,685
    - [growls]                  
    - [Patrick groaning]        

1183
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,187
    [Bernie groaning]           

1184
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,992
[Patrick] Bernie. The notes.    

1185
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:59,661
    Yes. I'll use the note.     

1186
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,196
            Careful.            

1187
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:04,733
    [Bernie straining]          

1188
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,236
    Step aside.                 
    I'm burnin' mad, now.       

1189
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:13,675
I'm gonna break this snake.     

1190
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:14,910
        Let's do this!          

1191
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:16,311
        No, wait!               

1192
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,679
        [all] Stop!             

1193
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,248
There's no stopping me now.     

1194
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,986
        Feel the burn!          

1195
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:27,689
Patrick, run! Or we're all      
going to be turned to ash.      

1196
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:28,824
        Ah, see that?           

1197
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:31,627
    That's how you do it.       

1198
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:35,297
    [Bernie laughing]           

1199
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,772
    I can't believe             
    we finally made it.         

1200
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,808
        [all groaning]          

1201
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,110
        I'm exhausted.          

1202
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,145
    I found this burnt          
    piece of paper.             

1203
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,714
- What is it?                   
- It's from the Fox Elder.      

1204
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:55,651
She told him to open it,        
when in desperate danger.       

1205
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,352
    So, what does it say?       

1206
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:00,722
    We must sacrifice one       
    for the sake of all.        

1207
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:04,026
        [all whimpering]        

1208
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:05,761
We should honor his sacrifice.  

1209
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,263
            Let's go rescue     
            Princess Angelica.  

1210
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,198
    [all grunting assent]       

1211
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:20,275
    [Crusher] This is where     
    the nine-headed snake       
    has been keeping her.       

1212
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:24,346
    - This is terrible.         
    - She's in a trance.        

1213
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,982
    - Princess Angelica.        
    - Is she alright?           

1214
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,417
    She can't hear us.          

1215
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:30,152
We have to hurry and save her.  

1216
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:33,422
Princess Angelica, I'll come    
over there and save you.        

1217
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:34,890
        No, wait.               

1218
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,391
        Stop. You can't.        

1219
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,026
        It's not safe.          

1220
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,729
The water is contaminated.      

1221
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:44,199
It's filled with evil poison.   
Don't touch it.                 

1222
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,369
GoGo Goat, use your whip        
and pull the princess clear.    

1223
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,738
- OK.                           
- No, that won't be sufficient. 

1224
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,175
    I calculate your whip       
    won't stand a chance        
    against those chains.       

1225
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,043
    Someone is gonna            
    have to cross the water     

1226
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,279
    and undo those              
    chains to free her.         

1227
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:00,782
    - Let me be the one.        
    - Huh?                      

1228
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:04,052
If I'd have taken down that     
snake when this all started,    

1229
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,189
    Bernie Hothead wouldn't     
    have had to finish him      
    by himself.                 

1230
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,224
It's the least I could do.      

1231
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,859
    [Crusher groaning]          

1232
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:12,394
            Ox, no!             

1233
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:15,864
    I'm the one to blame.       

1234
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:18,133
    When I was bewitched        
    by the Evil Master,         

1235
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:21,436
    I almost destroyed          
    Merryland with my rage.     

1236
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:24,072
    A sword cannot              
    break these chains.         

1237
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,842
    Only I have the             
    strength that can do it.    

1238
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:29,911
        [groaning]              

1239
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,492
        Almost there.           

1240
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,362
        Your highness.          

1241
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:50,098
    [Patrick] It was            
    too much for him.           

1242
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,500
[Spinny] That poor bovine.      

1243
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:53,168
    He'll be all right.         

1244
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,503
    So, how is she doing?       

1245
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:57,272
The power of the                
Dragon Ball will protect her.   

1246
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,508
Eventually, she will be fine.   

1247
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:03,278
    But as for Crusher,         
    I cannot say.               

1248
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,213
You gonna be OK, there, buddy?  

1249
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,382
    Don't worry about me.       

1250
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,985
    I finally did               
    something really good.      

1251
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,219
        Don't give up.          

1252
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,988
We'll find a way to cure you.   

1253
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,257
Eventually, I'll be fine.       

1254
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,860
    But you need to save        
    Princess Angelica.          

1255

    [everyone agreeing]         

1256
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:23,799
Wait. I still smell the snake.  

1257
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:26,134
[Billy] The snake? Where?       

1258
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,904
I thought he was gone for good. 

1259
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,006
So, what are we gonna do now?   

1260
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:33,575
    We've got to get the        
    princess and get outta here.

1261
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,144
    There's only one way        
    out of this chamber,        

1262
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,313
but it's blocked by the snake.  

1263
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,548
    We can't get out.           

1264
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,417
    Then why don't we           
    dig a new passage?

    - Nice to see you.          
    - How'd you find us?        

1270
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,029
I am a master of many skills.   

1271
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:56,298
We'll talk later, but for now,  
you must follow me.             

1272
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,368
Manny's right. We can talk about
all that once we've escaped.    

1273
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:03,371
    But first we must           
    get the princess.

1276
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,586
I can't hold it much longer.    

1277
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:18,987
            Try!                

1278
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,922
        Wait. I'm stuck.        

1279
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:23,859
You're right. I'm afraid the    
opening isn't quite big enough. 

1280
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:27,062
        - Allow me to--

        Peggy, go next.         
        Take Ox with you.       

1282
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,366
    - I can hold the door.      
    - No, I can hold it.        

1283
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,436
    - You get out with Ox.      
    - No. You leave first.      

1284
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:35,637
[Peggy] Wait. Get out of here.  

1285
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,439
    - [Patrick] You first.      
    - [Peggy] You go.           

1286
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,607
    [Patrick] No, you first.    

1287
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:41,276
I can hold back the snake.      
You two, go!                    

1288
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:44,346
        No, Crusher.            

1289
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,948
I've got this.                  
Escape while you still can.     

1290
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,550
Hurry, before it's too late!    

1291
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:51,219
I'll stay here,                 
but you have to save Merryland. 

1292
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,420
            Crusher!            

1293
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:54,222
You found your                  
courage, Patrick.               

1294
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,991
Now's the time to use it.

    How can it be OK?
